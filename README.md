# Advent of Code Solutions

This is my work for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Run a Solution

This command will run a specific solution. YEAR is the event year and DAY is the 2 digit day to be run. 

```CMD
npm run day {YEAR} {DAY}
```

## Setup

Input files are stored in a private submodule that is referenced by git in the project. 

After cloning the repo run these commands to setup the submodule

[More about git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

```CMD
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
